/* basically what this does is we have a longest line and its length in the main function.
   getthis opens up an input for the user, checks the length and the chars of every line.
   this is why newlines end the counting for i. and i returns an integer because we want the length
   we compare the length of every line to the longest line, if our current line is longer we
   copy that into longest and update the longest value.  */
